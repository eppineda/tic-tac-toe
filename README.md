# tic-tac-toe in angularjs
## Introduction ##
This project started as an exercise in learning *AngularJS* directives. As such, it is an AngularJS application. **Version 1.0** is played on a single computer screen, each player taking a turn with the keyboard. The game automatically tracks progress, announcing wins or draws when the game comes to a conclusion.
## Installation ##
To play the game, simply download the source and open **index.html** with the browser of your choice.
## In the Works ##
**Version 2.0** is expected to support play over the Internet, with automatic match-making when you start the application within your browser.
